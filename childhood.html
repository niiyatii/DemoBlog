<h1>MY Childhood</h1>
<p>I was born in Gujarat at my grandfathers house. I was a very obident, sincere and pretty docile girl in my childhood. I was brought up in Hyderabad and finished my schooling in St. Josephs Public School.
Having passed class 10 with flying colors, I joined intermediate with all hopes on joining IIT just like many other people here in Hyderabad. Unfortuantely I couldnt make it but I happened
to find my best friend and the most awesome person there. But life until here wasnt just as simple as it seems!
